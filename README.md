# Vocal Processing and Mixing Project

## Overview

This project provides Python scripts for advanced vocal processing and mixing. The scripts enable users to manipulate vocal tracks by reducing silences, speeding up the audio, applying delay-based reverb effects, and mixing the processed vocals with a beat. The project is structured into two main steps:

1. **Working Step 1:** Focuses on preprocessing the vocal track by reducing silences and speeding up the audio.
2. **Working Step 2:** Applies a simple delay-based reverb effect and mixes the processed vocals with a beat track.

These scripts are designed to be part of a Jupyter Notebook workflow but can be easily adapted for standalone Python applications.

## Installation

To run these scripts, you will need Python 3.x and the following packages:
- `numpy`
- `librosa`
- `soundfile`
- `audioread`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy librosa soundfile audioread
```
